##Part 1
In Pim’s team, we separate the team into frontend and backend. Within frontend, we have GameEditor, GameRunner and Menu modules. Within backend, we have Player, Status, Mode, Item, GameInstance, DataSaver and DataReader . We want to encapsulate the components in our game as much as possible. Thus, when we make changes in one part, other parts won’t be affected.

In David’s team, he separates the project into frontend and backend of game controller.engine and game authoring environment as well. Our designs are similar.
We both work on the game controller.engine part. Pim is mainly responsible for the front end of the game controller.engine. Her part is then linked to the data part of the back end. 
I think that the factories in the back end portion of the game controller.engine will throw errors and we have to deal with them proactively. I believe using the tools from the examples Professor Duvall gave us in class, we would be able to easily handle them.

##Part 2
The part that David is most excited about building the architecture of the game so that even non-programmers can build different games based on the flexible design of the components in my game design. David plans on working heavily with his teammates to complete a working basic implementation of the game. We hope to incorporate the different abilities of the characters to make the sprites interact with each other in meaningful ways.

Pim is excited about the integration part of the project. In this project, we work with nine other team members. Our codes are encapsulated from others’ codes. Pim hopes to learn more about passing data between each elements of the project using XML format.
