# Plan overview
====================

## Introduction
The primary goal of the project is to design a game maker controller.engine which specializes in 2D RPG style games, like Pokemon, Evoland, Zelda. The game that can be constructed are all similar in that there are set number of moveable locations defined in a model.grid, with only one possible element (character, landscape object, etc) occupying that space. Hence, for example, one’s model.player would not be able to stand in a tree cell. We will have clickable cells where the user can define the map, by placing ui.scenes.controller.editor.objects there. For certain ui.scenes.controller.editor.objects, like enemy players we will have settable attributes (like attack speed, attack damage, magic damage, etc). On the high level, after normal menu screen navigation, we create a new game with a set number of cells. There is a map which shows the relevant subsection of cells (which your character is standing on) and immediately surrounding locations as well as a minimap which displays how your region is in the entire frame of the world. Inside the game, there will be model.interactions with the environment and other characters that define the progression of the game until the condition is satisfied and the game is finally won.

## Overview
The general design of our program is split up into a front-end (the view) and a back-end (the model). The two main parts of the application will be game creation and gameplay. The game creation aspect allows the user to create and customize a game, and the gameplay version allows the user to actually play the game. When creating the game, the user will be able to create the game model.block by model.block and specify the state of each model.block. This way, the model can easily store what each location in the game represents. The view can then see an abstraction of these details and separately decide how to display the graphics.

## User Interface
At the home page, the user can select between build and play mode. In the play mode, an XML file with a standard overworld design will be loaded. In build mode, the user can build the overworld from a blank canvas and can choose to add obstacles and other NPCs, then the design is saved as an XML file. The canvas is represented as a model.grid of cells and, in build mode, there is a side menu where ui.scenes.controller.editor.objects can be added to the cells by clicking the cell, then selecting an object that appears in a pop up box. The user can also select multiple number of cells by using the mouse to drag and release across the area they desire and are then able to select the object they want to fill each of the selected cells with from a pop up box.
As for the game mode UI, there will be a model.grid display with the main character as the center of the section of the overworld being displayed (Pokemon display style). There will also be a side tab with the current game statistics, e.g. model.player health points, model.player experience points, remaining enemies. Dialog will appear as a pop up box at the bottom of the model.grid display. The game play will take in keyboard input to control the character moving through the overworld.

## Design Details

### Front-end
The front-end is separated from the back-end. The role of the View is as follows. First, the View must be able to take input from the users and then notify the back-end those user inputs. Second, the View must be able to display various model.block types on the UI. The key components of the View are as follows: GameEditor, GameRunner, Menu, GameObject and SceneManger.

The Game Editor module handles the creation of the game which entails creating the map, NPCs, dialogue and populating these on the Grid.  Grids, menus and user info must be initialized once the controller.editor is first run.  For the Grid, cells will be selected to store various game ui.scenes.controller.editor.objects ranging from boundaries/obstacles to NPCs.  Selection can be done via highlighting cells or clicking and dragging components into the model.grid.  Regardless, there are numerous edge conditions will need to be checked in order to make sure the ui.scenes.controller.editor.objects can fit in the allotted space.  For NPCs, we will need to initialize them, define their behavior (monster, trainer, etc) and provide interaction editing between the NPC and model.player.  With all of these we will need to be able to load a saved Game Creation and be able to edit it (also entails being able to save).  For the sake of frontend, we will most likely only have to read the loaded file from the Grid and animate (back end will handle saving and loading the Grid itself).   

The GameRunner module is in charge of running the game using the data from the game controller.engine. The GameOpener Class is in charge of parsing the data which is stored in XML format and set the game on the stage using openGame() method. GameRunner also displays the stats of the model.player. The Stat Class has three main methods: init() to initialize the front-end elements on the UI that display the stats, getStats() to get the current stats from the model and setStats() to update the stats on the model. In the GameRunner, an object of Emulator Class is instantiated to initialize a battlefield when the model.player runs into a person. The key methods of the Emulator are init() to initialize and set the screen as a battlefield/overworld, setPlayers() to set the current players, setMonsters() to current monsters and endGame() when the users win or lose.

The Menu module is used to generate the menu tabs containing buttons and other gameplay controls and will be used in the GameEditor and GameRunner for the tabs in the UI.  The GameObject module will take an image file and create an object with it that can be used in the GameEditor and GameRunner displays. The SceneManager module will handle changes in scenes as the model.player moves in and out of scenes or into new areas of the scene.

### Back-end
The map is generally stored as a model.grid of blocks. This way, the back-end can track the state of each position in the map, and these details are abstracted away from the front-end. Then the front-end can separately decide how to display the graphics of the blocks.

The Player object represents the main character(s) of the game, and everything centers and interacts with this class.

The Status and WinCondition modules allow users to specify win conditions and statuses of different attributes, which allows for a great deal of flexibility in terms of design.

The model.interactions could include model.player-model.block model.interactions (model.player walking around in the model.grid) and battle model.interactions (characters battling each other). This way, there can be a generalized event history for everything that occurs throughout the history of a game. This makes the design flexible because it allows users to specify a variety of model.interactions.

The Mode module allows the user to specify different types of modes, such as battle or walkaround mode, or any mode that the user wants. This is an integral part of the game design that performs an integral task in this program.

The Item module allows the user to define different types of items that a GamePlayer can use to interact with other ui.scenes.controller.editor.objects in the model.grid. The user can define items that can have a variety of effects on other ui.scenes.controller.editor.objects, such as HP, speed, power, etc.

The GameInstance module stores the stats of a certain game so that these can be easily displayed in the front-end. These stats are extracted into its own class to allow for greater code modularity and flexibility.

The DataSaver and DataReader modules are used to save and load game states into an XML file. This way, a user can load up pre-made games and does not need to design the same games over and over again. We decided to extract these functions into their own dedicated classes to allow for more code modularity and flexibility.

## Example Games

### Pokemon
The Pokemon video game series is arguably the most popular RPG series of games ever created. A model.player is accompanied by a party of Pokemon monsters that are used to battle various other trainers and explore the Pokemon world. Our environment allows for the creation of a open world to explore along with adding NPCs and giving these NPCs certain characteristics/weapons. In addition, it will be possible to interact with the NPCs, some of which you will be able to battle. Finally, there will be buildings that can be explored and even areas of the world that can only be accessed once a level has been reached. Given all of these base settings, the following games should also be able to be supported.

### Zelda
Zelda games (2D exploring ones like awakening): revolve around exploring the world, interacting with NPCs, exploring dungeons and battling low level enemies along with bosses.  Our authoring environment will allow the creation of the open world by default.  An extension that may be challenging is the dungeons, but these can be viewed as an extension of building a world, thus when a dungeon is encountered, we would just have to make sure we can allow traversal between the world and dungeon.  Other than that, we allow the creation of unique NPCs and an open world, thus this game should be feasible to build.

### Dragon Warrior / Dragon Quest
Similar to Pokemon, Dragon Warrior involves exploring a 2D overworld with an arsenal of “monsters” used for battling enemies and capturing other “monsters.” The basic premise of the Dragon Warrior games follows a story wherein the model.player represents a hero that sets out to save the land from peril caused by a super-evil enemy. Our game authoring environment will support creating an overworld along with NPCs with which the user can interact. However, unlike Pokemon and Zelda, a super-evil boss can be created that would serve as the winning condition, which is unique to Dragon Warrior (Pokemon, for example, is won when all battle-able players have been defeated). Furthermore, the goal of the game can be customized through the NPCs’ dialogues; the goal of “saving the land from peril” could be reflected in a game created through our game authoring environment by selecting dialogue that crafts this particular story.

## Design Considerations

### Front-end
* We need to think about how the grids are getting the updates from the back-end. We’re considering observer pattern. The observer pattern allows the view to be updated by the model while the view is encapsulated from the model.
* We need to consider how to place blocks in the workspace.  There are numerous edge cases to consider giving the design we choose.  Ideally we want to either minimize edge cases so we aren’t stuck checking numerous
* We need to consider how to animate the model.grid.  It is a mix of back end and front end so division of labor is confusing.  For updating the model.grid, we need to consider how we handle animations.  One option is to pass the Grid back and forth between front and back end but the preferred method is to use the Observable design pattern to update the model.grid (only pulling data we need, when we need it).

### Back-end
* We need to consider how to generalize all the types of model.interactions. These model.interactions could include model.player-model.block model.interactions (model.player walking around in the model.grid) and battle model.interactions (characters battling each other). This way, there can be a generalized event history for everything that occurs throughout the history of a game.
* We need to consider how we animate the model.grid.  The model.grid is a mix of both back end and front end so we need to figure out a flexible way to integrate things, because the model.grid is the entry point into the display and control of the entire program.
